# Exceptions to the Bytecode Alliance IP Policy

Per the Bytecode Alliance's [IP Policy](https://bytecodealliance.org/assets/ip-policy.pdf),
by default all hosted projects must use the [Project License](../../PROJECT_LICENSE) as their
outgoing license.

Per §4 of the IP Policy, the board may grant exceptions to this policy on a case-by-case basis.
As of now, the following exceptions have been granted:


## Wasm-tools

The [wasm-tools project](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/) has received
[approval](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/issues/1637#issuecomment-2192426077)
to use a triple license of `Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception OR Apache-2.0 OR MIT` for the entire
code base.

### Motivation

Enabling easy integration of parts of the project into the Rust compiler.


## Wit-bindgen

The [wit-bindgen project](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen/) has received
