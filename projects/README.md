# Bytecode Alliance Projects

A key purpose of the Bytecode Alliance is to provide a home for projects that further the mission of the Alliance. The Alliance's Technical Steering Committee (TSC) acts as the top-level body of governance for these projects, as described in the [TSC Charter](../TSC/charter.md#project-governance).

This directory acts as an overview of the projects that the Alliance hosts.

> **Note:** This directory is currently a simple list of links to websites or repositories. We are working on a more sophisticated way of presenting this information.
