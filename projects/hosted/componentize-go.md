# Proposal to create componentize-go
This document is a proposal to create `componentize-go` as a formal (Hosted) Project under the auspices of the TSC of the Bytecode Alliance, as specified in the [TSC Charter](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/governance/blob/main/TSC/charter.md).

## Project Summary
`componentize-go` is a project to create components using the Go programming language. It currently resides at https://github.com/asteurer/componentize-go/. We aim to make this tool the easiest, most efficient way to build components using Go.

## Governance Summary
This project will begin with @dicej (Joel Dice, Akamai), and @asteurer (Andrew Steurer, Volunteer) as the primary maintainers. By making this a hosted Bytecode Alliance project, we hope to attract additional contributors going forward.

## Software Development Process
The project will meet the passing criteria for the [OpenSSF best practices badge](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/criteria/0). Pull requests, issues, CI, and release management will be performed via GitHub.

## Alignment with Bytecode Alliance Mission and Goals
Bytecode Alliance projects represent the mission and goals of the Bytecode Alliance itself. We understand that as a Bytecode Alliance project, our project must adhere to the [TSC Charter](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/governance/blob/main/TSC/charter.md) and other governing documents (such as the [Security Policies](https://bytecodealliance.org/security) and [IP Policy](https://bytecodealliance.org/assets/ip-policy.pdf)). As a Bytecode Alliance project, our project's source code and other pieces of intellectual property will be assigned to the Bytecode Alliance.

We understand and agree that:

* All code for this project must be under the [Apache v2 License with the LLVM exception](https://github.com/PROJECT_LICENSE), unless an exception is required for compliance with existing licensing, and granted by the Bytecode Alliance's board of directors per [IP Policy](https://bytecodealliance.org/assets/ip-policy.pdf) §4. If our code is not already licensed accordingly, we will take the necessary steps to correct this prior to becoming a Bytecode Alliance Project.

* We will comply with the [Security Policies](https://bytecodealliance.org/security).

* Project name, trademarks, logos, wordmarks, and other intellectual property other than source code and documentation copyright is assigned to Bytecode Alliance per the [IP Policy](https://bytecodealliance.org/assets/ip-policy.pdf).

* Social media handles, GitHub repository access, and other relevant communication and coordination platforms will be overseen by Bytecode Alliance. Administrative/Owner permissions will be granted to the Bytecode Alliance for all such accounts.

* We will abide by the definition of a project as set forth in the [TSC Charter](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/governance/blob/main/TSC/charter.md).

* This project must remain under active development or maintenance, or it may be archived by the Bytecode Alliance.

* This project may be reviewed from time to time by the TSC, and project maintainers will assist with this review process.

* Project members will be able to participate in Bytecode Alliance governance, as specified in the [TSC Charter](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/governance/blob/main/TSC/charter.md) and other governing documents.
