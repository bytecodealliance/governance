# Proposal to Create `@bytecodealliance/jco-transpile`

This document is a proposal to create @bytecodealliance/jco-transpile as a formal Hosted Project under the auspices of
the TSC of the Bytecode Alliance, as specified in the TSCâ€™s charter.

Proposing the adoption of `jco-transpile` as a Bytecode Alliance hosted project.

Current Repository URL: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco

Proposed Repository URL: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco

The `jco-transpile` project should exist as a **subproject** of the [jco][jco] project which encapsulates *only* the
functionality required to perform a transpilation (WebAssembly component -> `import`-able JS project) offered by
`jco`.

The general plan is for the `jco-transpile` project to:

- Be hosted under `jco` yet individually installable/accessible via [NPM][npm], similar how [`@bytecodealliance/jco`][npm-jco] and [`@bytecodealliance/preview2-shim`][npm-p2-shim] are today
- Have source code in the [`jco` repository][jco] (`packages/jco-transpile/*`)
- Be usable by users who have [expressed an interest][jco-transpile-only-issue] to *only* use the transpilation functions of jco
- Enable `jco` to pivot towards becoming a multi-tool with good DX for JS adoption of WebAssembly

## Requirements

### Alignment with the Bytecode Alliance Mission

> Projects must have alignment with [the Bytecode Alliance mission:](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/governance/blob/main/mission.md)
>
> > Our mission is to provide state-of-the-art foundations to develop runtime environments and language toolchains where security, efficiency, and modularity can all coexist across a wide range of devices and architectures. We enable innovation in compilers, runtimes, and tooling, focusing on fine-grained sandboxing, capabilities-based security, modularity, and standards such as WebAssembly and WASI.
>
> The Bytecode Alliance is a group with a specific mission, and we therefore will only sponsor projects that are in alignment with and further that mission. For example, project sponsorship is untenable if the project undermines sandboxing, security, or standardization efforts.

The `jco-transpile` project would be aligned with the Bytecode Alliance mission in the same way that `jco` is today; providing state of the art toolchains
for the JS WebAssembly ecosystem. In particular, `jco transpile` works across a variety of platforms, and serves a crucial role in the ecosystem currently.

### Code Review

#### Description

> All projects must gate merging pull requests on code reviews that audit not only for style but also substance, such as whether security invariants are properly maintained by the new code.
>
> It is recommended, but not required, that hosted projects maintain a `CODEOWNERS` file and automatically assign reviewers as well.
>
> Code reviews have a demonstrable impact on the quality of source code by catching bugs early, determining the best possible implementation, and fostering trust within the community. Timely responses let contributors know that their work is valued and encourages further contribution.

The `jco-transpile` project is protected by both linters for style and tests for functionality and regression, along with code reviews as a part of the `jco` project.

### Code of Conduct

> All Bytecode Alliance projects must:
>
> * link to the Bytecode Alliance's Code of Conduct documents from a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file in root of the repository, and
> * enforce the codes of conduct among the community and contributors, or escalate to [the Bytecode Alliance CoC Team](mailto:report@bytecodealliance.org), if needed.
>
> Having a code of conduct is crucial for creating a positive and respectful environment in any organization, community, or group. It serves as a set of guidelines that outline expected behavior and ethical standards for all members involved.

The `jco-transpile` is a subproject of `jco` and thus already fulfills this requirement in-repo of having a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file, and enforcement.

### Continuous Integration Testing

> All projects must run continuous integration (CI) tests on all pull requests and merges. Key project features must be covered by CI.
>
> If any part of the CI gates on merging changes that is not reproducible by external contributors, then the project must make affordances to support those external contributors.
>
> Implementing CI offers several benefits to software projects, helping ensure correctness and quality, making it an essential practice for modern software development.

The `jco-transpile` functionality is already covered under CI as a part of `jco` and that testing would move towards the new subproject as well.

https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco/blob/a9f7aafe136c8f05026f2e833c90ae795691da8d/packages/jco/test/api.js#L42

### Contributor Documentation

> All projects must have a `CONTRIBUTING.md` document in the root of their repository. This document must provide, or link to another form of project-specific documentation that provides, high-quality contributor documentation.
>
> See ["How to build a `CONTRIBUTING.md`" by the Mozilla Science Lab](https://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/contributing/) for more details on what a high-quality `CONTRIBUTING.md` file looks like.
>
> A `CONTRIBUTING.md` serves as a guide for potential contributors, outlining the expectations for individuals who wish to contribute to the project. The Bytecode Alliance is a community-driven software foundation and documents like `CONTRIBUTING.md` are necessary for fostering community contributions.

The `jco-transpile` project shares a `CONTRIBUTING.md` document with `jco`, as a subproject.

### Following the Bytecode Alliance Operational Principles

> All projects must follow [the Bytecode Alliance Operational Principles](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/governance/blob/main/operational-principles.md).
>
> In pursuing our mission and vision, the Bytecode Alliance follows a set of operational principles aimed at keeping us aligned on three key aspects: what we want to create, how we want to work together, and how we want to work with others.

The `jco-transpile` project follows the Bytecode Alliance operational principles as a subproject of `jco`.

### Licensing Compatible with the Bytecode Alliance

> All projects must be licensed under the Apache 2.0 license with an LLVM exception. Exemptions may be granted by the board.
>
> All projects must only use dependencies and third-party code licensed under one of the following open source licenses:
>
> * Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception
> * Apache-2.0
> * BSD-2-Clause
> * BSD-3-Clause
> * ISC
> * MIT
> * MPL-2.0
> * OpenSSL
> * Unicode-DFS-2016
> * Zlib
>
> All dependencies and third-party code must be properly attributed.
>
> The source for all projects must be available to all members and must be available to all non-members under the same license.
>
> All projects must automatically ensure that licensing requirements of dependencies are met in CI.
>
> We strive to build an open community and a legally-compatible software ecosystem.

The `jco-transpile` project will have a license similar to `jco` -- `Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception`.

### README

> All hosted projects must have a `README.md` file in the root of the repository which begins with:
>
> * The project name and logo (if one exists)
> * A one-sentence description of the project
> * `<strong>A <a href="https://bytecodealliance.org/">Bytecode Alliance</a> hosted project</strong>`
>
> The most important information about the project should be "above the fold". Projects should identify themselves as Bytecode Alliance projects so that, with time, people associate the Bytecode Alliance with quality projects that they can rely on.

The `jco-transpile` subproject benefits from the README for the `jco` project and will have it's own subproject-specific README file in addition.

### Release Process

> Documentation of a release process that any project maintainer may execute to create a new release version of the software.
>
> Multiple people must have permissions to publish releases. A github team must have access to publish packages and package ownership on the associated package repository when possible. For example a Rust project may have multiple owners on crates.io.
>
> Projects and their releases shouldn't be tied to any single user's machine or keys to ensure continuity of the project. A project isn't an open, community project if only one person can publish releases.
>
> Automation makes fewer mistakes than humans, and getting releases right is critical, since only releases are typically used downstream, not random commits from `main`.

The `jco-transpile` subproject benefits from the fully automated release process for `jco` project, with publish ability enabled by a bot account:

https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco/pull/686

Once the NPM package has not been created under the `@bytecodealliance` organization, multiple organization members will be added to ensure access.

### Security Process

> All projects must have a documented security process for reporting and disclosing vulnerabilities, managing patches that fix vulnerabilities, and announcing and making available security releases. Furthermore, projects must actually follow their documented processes.
>
> It is recommended that request Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) numbers for discovered vulnerabilities and report the CVE when disclosing the vulnerability.
>
> A tool like [dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) may suffice for hosted projects. Dependabot should be used for security updates only, and not apply all updates indiscriminantly. Updating dependencies should otherwise be done with intention (never automatically). Automatic creation of pull requests is acceptable, but manual review is required to prevent supply chain attacks.
>
> Bytecode Alliance projects must be a secure foundation for others to build upon. Transparency and a managed security release process is key to being this foundation.

The `jco-transpile` subproject benefits from `jco`s established security posture and process, along with enabled dependabot CI integration.

### Semantic Versioning

> All projects must follow either standard semantic versioning or their ecosystem's local-dialect of semantic versioning (for example, Rust and `cargo`'s interpretation of semantic versioning slightly differs from the standard, but is acceptable for Rust Bytecode Alliance projects).
>
> A clear versioning scheme is necessary for end-users. We desire consistency across projects and so the Bytecode Alliance has adopted semantic versioning as a required best practice.

The `jco-transpile` subproject will be separately versioned according to semantic versioning guidelines.

### Secrets Management

> GitHub organization and repository level secrets should be used. Secrets must not be hard coded in source.
>
> For secrets like passwords for the project's associated social media account, these should be stored in the password service paid for by the Bytecode Alliance. Contact the TSC for access and ability to manage a given secret.
>
> Secure secret management is a requirement for a secure project. Additionally, projects and their associated accounts shouldn't be tied to any single user's machine or keys to ensure continuity of the project. A project isn't an open, community project if only one person can access its accounts.

The inherited actions that `jco-transpile` uses as a subproject of `jco` are properly scoped, and are not included in the source code. Relevant bot accounts credentials
have also been submitted to the Bytecode Alliance-controlled password services.

### Supply Chain Security

> All projects must follow a well-documented process for updating dependencies and auditing them for malicious supply-chain attacks.
>
> When applicable, projects should:
>
> * Integrate auditing tools in CI (such as `cargo vet`)
> * Use code review and static analysis tools on dependencies
>
> Finally, projects must document and follow their process for responding to upstream vulnerabilities in dependencies.
>
> Our mission of developing runtime environments and language toolchains where security, efficiency, and modularity can all coexist necessarily means that we have performed our due dilligence to mitigate software supply chain attacks.

`jco-transpile` inherits the Depdendabot settings of it's parent project `jco` to stay up to date along with an emphasis on vetting dependencies during code review.

### Sustainable Contributor Base

> All projects must have regular contributions from multiple contributors.
>
> It is recommended that hosted projects additionally have contributors affiliated with at least two different Bytecode Alliance organizations and that the project's leadership has representation from at least two different Bytecode Alliance organizations.
>
> There must not be any private information necessary to fully contribute to the project.
>
> A project is not considered healthy with only one contributor. An open, community project requires input from multiple stakeholders and does not rely on a single person.
>
> The TSC may waive the above contributor base requirements under certain conditions. In particular, the TSC may decide to adopt crucial upstream dependencies of existing Bytecode Alliance projects that are otherwise effectively unmaintained or only have a single maintainer.

`jco-transpile` benefits from a wide pool of Jco maintainers, both in the form of issues and fixes via pull request:

TODO: Examples

### Version Control

> All projects must be hosted on [the Bytecode Alliance Organization](github.com/bytecodealliance) on GitHub.
>
> Access controls are managed via the Bytecode Alliance organization on GitHub. This allows for continuity of the project when hosted in one place. Finally, this is the only way to reasonable manage the projects within the organization.

TODO: argument that this requirement is fulfilled and supporting evidence (such as links to code, documentation, issues, and pull requests)

## Recommendations

### Changelog

> It is recommended that hosted projects highlight key additions, breaking changes, security fixes, and otherwise noteworthy changes in a changelog.
>
> See [keepachangelog.com](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) for a recommended approach.
>
> We are building an ecosystem that developers can depend on, and one small part of that is communicating important changes downstream.

`jco-transpile` inherits from `jco`'s release process which makes use of conventional commits and changelogs:

https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco/releases/tag/jco-v1.11.2

### Continuous Fuzzing

> Not all projects will necessarily benefit from fuzzing, for example benchmark suites. The TSC may choose lift this requirement for a particular project.
>
> It is recommended that hosted projects have 24/7, round the clock, continuous fuzzing. The fuzzing should exercise significant amounts of the code base and test the project's most important properties, such as sandboxing. Bugs and vulnerabilities discovered via fuzzing should be addressed promptly.
>
> Part of our open-source and open contribution model, the corpus and setup for running fuzzing should be open-sourced as part of the project.
>
> Faults discovered via fuzzing must be reported privately to the project's core team so that the project's security vulnerability process can be followed properly, if necessary. For example, fuzzing infrastructure must not automatically open public issues for any fault that is discovered.
>
> Continuous fuzzing is a valuable practice for projects, due to its significant benefits in improving security and reliability. Within the Bytecode Alliance, we host projects that provide a sandbox. The fidelity of these sandboxes must be battle-tested via a number of methodologies including automated fuzzing.

`jco` is not currently fuzzed and while `jco-transpile` may somehow be, it is not currently planned in the near future.

### End-User Documentation

> We abide by [the OpenSSF requirements for documentation](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en):
>
> > The documentation of an external interface explains to an end-user or developer how to use it. This would include its application program interface (API) if the software has one. If it is a library, document the major classes/types and methods/functions that can be called. If it is a web application, define its URL interface (often its REST interface). If it is a command-line interface, document the parameters and options it supports. In many cases it's best if most of this documentation is automatically generated, so that this documentation stays synchronized with the software as it changes, but this isn't required. The project MAY use hypertext links to non-project material as documentation. Documentation MAY be automatically generated (where practical this is often the best way to do so).
>
> Furthermore, we identify a few different types of (sometimes overlapping) documentation:
>
> * **API documentation**: Documentation for each type, method, function, and module in a library.
> * **Architectural overviews**: High-level documentation about the architecture of the project and how it works from a 1000-foot view that helps endusers take advantage of the project in the best way possible and helps onboard new contributors.
> * **Examples**: Code examples that show off how to use the project as a whole or particular features it supports.
> * **Guides and tutorials**: Long-form prose, with code samples interspersed, that shows how to accomplish a task using the project.
>
> API and CLI flag documentation is required for hosted projects; all other types are recommended.
>
> Documentation is necessary for end-users to productively use the project; source code comments are not sufficient.

`jco-transpile` benefits from the existence [`jco` book][jco-book] and once released and made usable via NPM, it will be added as a section therein.

[jco-book]: https://bytecodealliance.github.io/jco/

### Issue Triage Process

> Hosted projects must use an issue tracker for tracking individual issues.
>
> It is recommended that hosted projects should additionally have a documented process for expeditiously triaging incoming issues and pull requests, and follow that process. Contributors should get prompt responses to their issues and pull requests, even if a response is not an immediate fix or review.
>
> For a successful community-driven project, expedient communication within issues and PRs encourages further collaboration and contribution.

`jco-transpile` relieas on the `jco` repository's use of GitHub Issues:

https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco/issues

### Leverage the Bytecode Alliance RFC Process

> A request for comments (RFC) is a technique for soliciting the community and contributors for feedback on proposed major changes and decisions.
>
> It is recommended that hosted projects follow [the Bytecode Alliance RFC process](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs/blob/main/accepted/rfc-process.md) for changes that significantly affect project stakeholders or contributors. The RFCs repo describes [when an RFC is needed](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs/#when-is-an-rfc-needed) in more detail:
>
> > Many changes to Bytecode Alliance projects can and should happen through every-day GitHub processes: issues and pull requests. An RFC is warranted when:
> >
> > * The work involves changes that will significantly affect stakeholders or project contributors. Each project may provide more specific guidance. Examples include:
> >     * Major architectural changes
> >     * Major new features
> >     * Simple changes that have significant downstream impact
> >     * Changes that could affect guarantees or level of support, e.g. removing support for a target platform
> >     * Changes that could affect mission alignment, e.g. by changing properties of the security model
> > * The work is substantial and you want to get early feedback on your approach.
>
> This is a best practice for aligning contributors, the community, and downstream projects' needs with proposed technical implementations.

`jco` does not currently utilize the RFC process, and at present `jco-transpile` as a subproject would not either, but this is open for future discussion.

Currently large features and changes made to `jco` are discussed first most often in bi-weekly SIG Guest Languages JS meetings which serve as a place to
solicit feedback from the community and contributors.

### Production Use

> It is recommended that hosted projects have demonstrated use in production by at least three independent organizations which are, in the TSC's judgement, of adequate quality and scope.
>
> It is recommended that projects track production usage by organizations in an `ADOPTERS.md` at the root of the project, for example see [`ADOPTERS.md`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md) in Wasmtime.
>
> Projects should demonstrate that they are practical, useful, and reliable enough to use in production.

As a subproject of `jco-transpile` and a crucial part of `jco`, `jco-transpile` is used by at least the following independent organizations:

- Cosmonic
- Fermyon
- Arcjet (the users requesting the creation of this subproject)

As `jco` is effectively the entrypoint on the JS side into the WebAssembly ecosystem, there are amany organizations not listed above, both large and small.

### Public Project Meetings and Notes

> It is recommended that hosted projects hold regular and public project meetings. Meeting times and frequency should be advertised publicly, for example in the project's `CONTRIBUTING.md`. To avoid spam and "Zoom bombing", the video conferencing link need not be public, but should be available upon request.
>
> Agendas for upcoming meetings and notes from past meetings should be published publicly. The notes should be in the `bytecodealliance/meetings` repository.
>
> Public meetings encourage open communication, collaboration, and engagement within the project's community. Notes allow community members who were not present to remain aligned and can document any decisions made during the meeting.

`jco-transpile` will be discussed during regular [SIG Guest Languages Javascript meetings][sig-js-meetings].

[sig-js-meetings]: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/meetings/tree/main/SIG-Guest-Languages/JavaScript

### Sanitizers and Code Analysis

> Static and dynamic code analysis tools (such as `valgrind` or `miri`) where applicable are recommended to be used by hosted projects.
>
> It is recommended that hosted projects with non-trivial amounts of unsafe code (e.g. `unsafe` in Rust or any C/C++)  run tests and fuzzers with the relevant sanitizers: Address Sanitizer, Memory Sanitizer, Thread Sanitizer, etc.
>
> Automated code analysis is key to meeting our mission of developing runtime environments and language toolchains where security, efficiency, and modularity can all coexist.
