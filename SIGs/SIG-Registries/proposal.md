# Proposal to Create SIG-Registries

This document is a proposal to create SIG-Registries as a formal Special Interest Group (SIG) under the auspices of the TSC of the Bytecode Alliance, as specified in the TSC’s charter. 

SIG-Registries's primary goal is to describe and refine a suitable registry system (or packaging system) for a component-oriented WebAssembly development model. The scope of this SIG is limited to discussions about the registry, being informed by adjacent technologies such as the component model, current WASI work, and other registries in the broader ecosystem. While it is not an express goal of the group, it is understood that in the process of designing, the group will produce proof-of-concept code. 

As deliverables of the SIG, the group will produce Notes describing the registry and its operations, as well as code that illustrates some or all of the described features. Should the TSC accept these Notes, the SIG will refine them into a position or recommendation. 

Should the code artifacts prove generally useful, the SIG may also approach the TSC about turning one or more of these efforts into a Core or At Large Project. As part of this process, the SIG will delegate some or all of its participants as maintainers of any code that will continue development after the SIG is complete.
