# Special Interest Groups

The Bytecode Alliance is focused on creating secure, foundational technology for WebAssembly, including WASI. However, it’s become clear that there is significant community interest in discussions around the application of that technology to vertical use cases.

To accommodate those discussions and assure that the community’s valuable feedback can be channeled into the Bytecode Alliance’s core functions, the charter for the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) empowers it to authorize and oversee Interest Groups.

## What is an Interest Group?

A Interest Group is a group of Bytecode Alliance members (and invited participants; see below) who share an interest in a particular application or aspect of the technology that the Bytecode Alliance is working on. IGs serve as a channel for practitioners and users of BA technology to give feedback and input to the development of its technology, as well as a space for them to discuss how to use it.

## Current SIGs
Currently active Bytecode Alliance SIGs (and their respective Chairpersons) include:
* SIG Registries (Robin Brown and Calvin Prewitt, Co-chairs)
