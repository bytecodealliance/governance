# Proposal to Create SIG-Packaging

This document is a proposal to create SIG-Packaging as a formal Special Interest Group (SIG)
under the auspices of the TSC of the Bytecode Alliance, as specified in the TSCâ€™s charter. 

SIG-Packaging's primary goal is to describe and build packaging tools as well as design
supporting registry systems for a component-oriented WebAssembly development model. The scope
of this SIG is limited to discussions about the packaging and distributing of Wasm, being
informed by adjacent technologies such as the component model, current WASI work, and registries
in the broader ecosystem. The group will produce docs and code as deliverables.

This group was formerly known as SIG-Registries and was renamed SIG-Packaging to align with
a change of scope and objectives.
