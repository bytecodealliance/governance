# Proposal to Create SIG-Packaging

This document is a proposal to create SIG-Packaging as a formal Special Interest Group (SIG)
under the auspices of the TSC of the Bytecode Alliance, as specified in the TSCâ€™s charter. 

SIG-Packaging's primary goal is to describe and build packaging tools that improve the
developer distribution experience, for both consumers and publishers, of WebAssembly components.
The tools should help programming language tools integrate WebAssembly components for consuming and
publishing Wasm component libraries. The group should seek to further registry designs
but also integrate with other solutions.

This group was formerly known as SIG-Registries and was renamed SIG-Packaging to align with
a change of scope and objectives.
