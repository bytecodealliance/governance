# Proposal to Create SIG-Packaging

This document is a proposal to create SIG-Packaging as a formal Special Interest Group (SIG)
under the auspices of the TSC of the Bytecode Alliance, as specified in the TSCâ€™s charter. 

SIG-Packaging's primary goal is to describe and build packaging tools that improve the
developer distribution experience, for both consumers and publishers, of WebAssembly components.
The tools should help guest and host toolchains integrate WebAssembly components for consuming and
publishing Wasm components. The group should seek to further registry designs
but also create integrations and coordinate with other related packaging efforts.

Key deliverables and areas of focus:
- Development of `wkg` and `wasm-pkg-tools` for consuming and publishing components to OCI and Warg registries;
- Supporting the development and use of the Warg registry protocol and tooling;
- Identify and document stakeholder requirements for discovering and consuming Wasm components;

This group was formerly known as SIG-Registries and was renamed SIG-Packaging to align with
a change of scope and objectives.
