# Proposal to Create SIG-Debugging

This document is a proposal to create SIG-Debugging as a formal Special Interest
Group (SIG) under the auspices of the TSC of the Bytecode Alliance, as specified
in the TSCâ€™s charter.

SIG-Debugging's primary goal is to design new debugging tools for WebAssembly
and new debugging features for Bytecode Alliance WebAssembly runtimes. The scope
of this SIG is limited to design discussions about debugging and adjacent topics
such as profiling. While it is not an express goal of the group, it is
understood that in the process of designing, the group may produce
proof-of-concept code.

As deliverables of the SIG, the group will collaborate on RFCs for existing
projects like Wasmtime and produce proposals (subject to TSC approval)
describing new standalone tools to become Bytecode Alliance hosted projects. The
group itself will not implement new tools or features directly. However, members
of the group may overlap with the set of people eventually implementing accepted
proposals and RFCs.
