# Proposal to Create SIG Documentation

This document is a proposal to create SIG-Documentation as a formal Special Interest Group (SIG) under the auspices of the TSC of the Bytecode Alliance, as specified in the TSC's charter.

SIG-Documentation's goal is to create, maintain, and promote documentation of the Bytecode Alliance ecosystem. The scope of the SIG focuses on ecosystem-wide documentation, such as documentation of the component model; rather than on tailoring documentation of specific Bytecode Alliance projects. However, the SIG may give recommendations to projects on how to best structure their documentation for consistency within the Bytecode Alliance.

The group may also create open source tooling to help generate documentation, such as reference documentation of WIT interfaces (`wit-docs-gen`).

As an immediate deliverable of the SIG, the group will produce and maintain centralized documentation on the component model inside the [`component-docs` repository](github.com/bytecodealliance/component-docs). The group will communicate asynchronously (on Zulip) and synchronously through regular Zoom meetings to discuss current initiatives.
